# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1  
## Cyber Security Fundamentals & Attack Surface Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents **Task 1** of the Cyber Security Internship, focused on building a strong foundation in **cybersecurity fundamentals**, understanding **attack surfaces**, identifying **threat actors**, and gaining awareness of the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**.  
The task emphasizes translating theoretical concepts into **real-world security understanding**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand core cybersecurity principles using the **CIA Triad**
- Identify different **types of cyber attackers**
- Analyze common **attack surfaces** in modern applications
- Gain awareness of **OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities**
- Map **real-world applications** to potential security risks
- Understand **data flow** and identify possible attack points

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

### 1. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data accuracy and protection from unauthorized modification  
- **Availability** – Ensuring systems and services remain accessible when needed  

Real-world examples from banking systems, email platforms, and social media applications are included.

### 2. Types of Cyber Attackers
- Script Kiddies  
- Insider Threats  
- Hacktivists  
- Cyber Criminals  
- Nation-State Actors  

Each attacker type is explained based on motivation, skill level, and attack objectives.

### 3. Attack Surface Analysis
The project identifies common attack surfaces such as:
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- APIs
- Network services
- Cloud infrastructure
- Email systems  

The analysis highlights how increased attack surface leads to higher security risk.

### 4. OWASP Top 10 Awareness
An overview of critical web application vulnerabilities, including:
- Injection attacks
- Broken authentication
- Security misconfigurations
- Sensitive data exposure
- Broken access control  

The importance of OWASP Top 10 in application security and risk management is explained.

---

### 5. Real-World Application Mapping
Daily-use applications such as:
- Email services
- Banking applications
- Messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp)

are mapped to their respective attack surfaces and possible threat scenarios.
